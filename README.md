A smart positioning collimator which reduces manual work,cost & radiation, and improves accuracy

# Problems
- Problem 1 -
The general X-ray
workflow starts from
patient entries,
registration, preparation,
system adjustment, and
finally acquiring the
image. There are many
manual tasks involved in
this flow which consume
lots of time and chances
of mistake and re-take of
image is likely.
- Probem 2 - The workload can be a
factor in increasing the
likelihood of errors in
radiology reporting. A variety
of studies have shown that
most abnormal findings on
plain radiographs are found
during the first few seconds
of searching the image, with
the number of true-positive
findings decreasing abruptly
after a short time.
- Problem 3 - With estimates of average
diagnostic error rates ranging
from 3% to 5%, there are
approximately 40 million
diagnostic errors involving
imaging annually worldwide.
The potential to improve
diagnostic performance and
reduce patient harm by
identifying and learning from
these errors is substantial. Yet
these relatively high diagnostic
error rates have persisted in
our field despite decades of
research and interventions.
# Solution -
### Swayam - 
An AI Based solution wherein CORRECT POSITIONING INFORMATION WILL BE CHECKED
WITH ANY ERROR AND REQUIRED ADJUSTMENT IS
PRESENTED TO THE RADIOGRAPHER. THIS INCLUDES
SHOULDER HEIGHT, PATIENT CONTACT WITH BUCKY, POSE
CENTER ALIGNMENT, ORIENTATION, TILT, AND HAND
POSITION.
THE SMART POSITIONING CAPABILITY ALLOWS THE
RADIOGRAPHER TO CORRECT POSITIONING ERRORS
PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, THEREBY REDUCING THE
TIME, COST, AND ADDITIONAL DOSE ASSOCIATED WITH A
REPEAT EXPOSURE WHILE IMPROVING IMAGE
CONSISTENCY.
